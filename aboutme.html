            <p>Hey, my name is Brennen Daudlin and I am currently an undergraduate
                studying at the College of Engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor
                for a bachelors, and eventually a masters, in computer science.
                I'm currently in my third year in college and I'm well experienced in C++, C, Python, Matlab, Javascript,
                and various other languages with some proficiency in Lua and Julia. During my time in college and high school,
                I've taken numerous classes beneficial to software engineering and coding as a whole such as those found in the
                class section of my portfolio. I'm always looking forward to new challenges that'll help me with my career in 
                programming and I do hope that you may see potential in me as someone you may consider hiring.</p>

            <p>In regards to my more personal life, I currently shoot Olympic Rifle for the Michigan Rifle Team and serve as the
                    team's Financial Officer. Before coming to the University of Michigan, I was on my local high school's FRC robotics
                    teams, Team 68, Truck Town Thunder, where I served as the teams electrical and data collection / strategy project
                    leader for 3 years. When I'm not busy with clubs or school work, I like to chat with friends from both on campus
                    and those who I went to high school with as they're almost family to me.</p>
